							<ul> 
								<li>So Where did Javascript come from?</li>
								<li>Originally, it was developed as a server-side scripting language</li>
								<li>Developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, while he was working for Netscape.</li>
								<li>Supposedly he developed it in a week</li>
								<li>Which adds to its cred and also it criticism</li>
								<li>it was developed under the name Mocha, it shipped being called Livescript, and was later changed to JavaScript aka ECMAScript.</li>
								<hr />
								<li>They attached the name Java to confuse and hopefully attract developers that were using the hot new langauage Java.</li>
								<li>Begining in 1996 standards were written, Netscape pushed it into the Browser and of course Microsoft refused to play along and developed JScript a port of javascript.</li>
								<li>which contributed to what is known as the browser wars</li>
								<li>this devide left javascript and jscript both neglected and it wasn't until</li>
								<li>1996, Netscape announced that it had submitted JavaScript to Ecma International for consideration as an industry standard. Subsequent work resulted in the standardized version named ECMAScript.</li>
								<li>Currently javascript is at ECMAScript 6 published in 2015</li>

							<p>We are talking about The Document Object Model or the "DOM", This is a cross-platform and language independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML</p>
							<p>With the DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements in a HTML document</p>
								<ul>
								<li>The history of the Document Object Model is intertwined with these "browser wars"</li>
								<li>eventually W3C began working on a standardized DOM
									<ul>
										<li>DOM Level 2 was published in late 2000. It introduced the "getElementById", which is still used today</li>
										<li>the current release, DOM Level 3 came out in 2003</li>
