# Developer and the DOM - A history of manipulation and abstraction

As web developers we have tons of tools that make our lives easier by abstracting away the foundational elements of the web. In this talk we'll trace the lineage of how we made it from the first dom implementation to the rich client application frameworks of today.

In the early days we had the DOM with a simple API and we slathered it in event listeneres anytime we needed to do something interesting. jQuery came along and gave us a simplified API that was consistent across all major browsers. Eventually we began automating DOM manipulations in frameworks like...

As web developers we often adopt and learn new tools to make our lives easier. They come with specific APIs that may give the developer a totally different development experience than the browswer had intend. We're going to cover the history of web development from the birth of the DOM up to the slew of contemporary tools we currently have available for building rich browser applications. All the while stringing together a narrative of specific challenges and accomplishments and forks in the path of progress.


notes:
* maybe list some small specifics such as event listeners -> diffing algorithms
* performance issues
