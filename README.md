# Developer-and-the-DOM
A presentation on the history of the developer's interaction with the DOM.

# Abstract
### Developer and the DOM - A history of manipulation and abstraction

As web developers we see a variety of tools evolve every year that all claim to be the future of web development, but few people are as excited to explore the past. In this talk we’ll trace the lineage of the contemporary web landscape back to the advent of the DOM and the first browser javascript API. In doing so we hope to illuminate an often overlooked historical perspective on web development and explain why frameworks like React and Angular came into existence and why today is an exciting time to be working with the browser.

We will provide an overview of the history of the web from the developer’s perspective while focusing on paradigmatic turning points. We will discuss how historical problem solving can make us better at what we do. We will share our personal woes, lessons, and victories from years of experience in the industry. We will compare the basic architectural paradigms of a couple of contemporary client side frameworks. And after mapping our way through the history of web development we will look at what the near future may hold.
