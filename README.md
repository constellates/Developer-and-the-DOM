# Developer and the DOM - A history of manipulation and abstraction

As web developers we often adopt and learn new tools to make our lives easier. They come with specific APIs that may give the developer a totally different development experience than the browswer had intend. We're going to cover the history of web development from the birth of the DOM up to the slew of contemporary tools we currently have available for building rich browser applications. All the while stringing together a narrative of specific challenges and accomplishments and forks in the path of progress.


notes:
* maybe list some small specifics such as event listeners -> diffing algorithms
* performance issues
